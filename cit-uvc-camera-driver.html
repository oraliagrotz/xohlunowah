What I mean is this: I want to "replace" my phone's terrible camera with a webcam I use for my computer by simply plugging it in, but to do that I'd need an adapter.

I'd really like to get a dash cam, but everything I see requires non-free software to run and uses proprietary video compression formats. Does anybody know of any video/audio cameras that RMS himself would use? I doubt there's a dash cam specifically, but maybe something small could be jerry rigged, but I can't even find an RMS friendly video camera Pretty much what it says in the subject. If so, send me a PM please. I posted this on /r/linux and had a suggestion to post it here. Original post: gtHello! I've never actually made a post before (only comments) but I wanted to post about this and see if anyone can give me some ideas. Also, I'm not entirely sure this is the right subreddit to post this, but it is Linux related so I felt it would be alright. gt gtNow onto my problem.

I first noticed that in the app Cheese the webcam max resolution was only 640x480 even in settings, I could only change it to a max of 640x480 SO my webcam doesn't seem to be working right.

I want to use DogeCV with a UVC Camera, but I have no idea where to start.

I want to use the sampling detector, so if anyone could help that would be great. We'd like to get going on prototyping with the newly allowed UVC cameras. Does anyone know if this is handled through a Android driver or if we will need an SDK update that gives access to the cameras? Also, should we be concerned at all about compatibility with the camera we purchase? For instance, is "UVC" an actual standard that allows a common driver, or is it a general term applied to USB devices capable of providing video streams.
